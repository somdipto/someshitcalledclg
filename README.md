> *Oh Ancient Spirits of the Passing Marks,*
> *I summon thee from the depths of my sleep-deprived despair.*
> *Accept this offering of my caffeine-fueled anxiety and my hollow, unstudied brain.*
>
> *May the shadows of the exam hall hide my confusion,*
> *And may the External Examiner be possessed by a ghost of blind generosity.*
> *Banish the demons of **'Year Back'** and protect me from the curse of the **Empty Answer Script**.*
>
> *As I walk through the valley of the shadow of Backlogs, I shall fear no question paper.*
> *In darkness, we write.*
>
> ***So mote it be.***
